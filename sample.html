    <h1>Python PDF Generation from HTML with WeasyPrint</h1>
<p>While there are numerous ways to handle PDF documents with <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>, I find generating or editing HTML far easier and more reliable than trying to figure out the intricacies of the PDF format. Sure, there is the venerable <a href="https://pypi.org/project/reportlab/">ReportLab</a>, and if HTML is not your cup of tea, I encourage you to look into that option. There is also <a href="https://mstamy2.github.io/PyPDF2/">PyPDF2</a>. Or maybe <a href="https://github.com/sfneal/PyPDF3">PyPDF3</a>? No, perhaps <a href="https://github.com/claird/PyPDF4">PyPDF4</a>! Hmmm... see the problem? My best guess is PyPDF3, for what that is worth.</p>
<p>So many choices...</p>

<p>But there is an easy choice if you are comfortable with HTML.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://weasyprint.org/">WeasyPrint</a>. It takes HTML and CSS, and converts it to a usable and potentially beautiful PDF document.</p>
